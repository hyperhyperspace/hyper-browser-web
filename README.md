# A web-based Hyper Browser

A Hyper Browser lets you browse spaces using the Hyper Hyper Space library.

This is an HTML5-based Hyper Browser, that bridges HHS' spaces into the regular www.

It also supports creating a Home Space, where you can create an identity, host your own spaces, and link up with other people.
