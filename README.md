# A web-based Hyper Browser

A Hyper Browser lets you browse spaces using the Hyper Hyper Space library.

This is an HTML5-based Hyper Browser, that bridges HHS' spaces into a regular, static webpage.

It also supports creating a Home Space, where you can create an identity, host your own spaces, and link up with other people.

Instead of checking out this project directly, please grab Hyper Hyper Space's [monorepo](https://github.com/hyperhyperspace/workspace).

After following the instructions to build the workspace in the monorepo, you'll find this repo in the path @hyper-hyper-space/hyper-browser-web.

There you can do:

`yarn start`

Runs a local copy of the website in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`yarn build`

Builds the static Hyper Browser page, that you can deploy. No other infrastructure is necessary, everything runs inside the client browser.
