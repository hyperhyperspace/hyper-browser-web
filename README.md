# A web-based Hyper Browser

WIP - this is just an HTML mock-up at the moment !

A Hyper Browser lets you browse spaces using the Hyper Hyper Space library.

This is an HTML5-based Hyper Browser, that bridges HHS' spaces into the regular, static webpage.

It also supports creating a Home Space, where you can create an identity, host your own spaces, and link up with other people.

`yarn start`

Runs a local copy of the website in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`yarn build`

Builds the static Hyper Browser page, that you can deploy. No other infrastructure is necessary, everything runs inside the client browser.
